# Tech_Blog
A CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. Hosted by Heroku, this application follows the MVC pagadigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. 

Several node package modules are utilized; express-handlebars package implements Handlebars.js for views, MySQL2 and Sequelize packages connect to a MySQL database for models, and create an Express.js API for Controllers, dotenv package is for environment variables, bcrypt package hashes passwords, and express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages add authentication.

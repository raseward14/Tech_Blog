# Tech_Blog
A CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. Hosted by Heroku, this application follows the MVC pagadigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
